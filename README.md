### Description
Welcome to our project! We are thrilled to showcase a music discovery app that allows users to search for and find music and information about their favorite artists. This music search page was built using Bulma framework.

With this application, users can type in the name of any artist, and receive multiple links showing different types of information about them. When the user searches for an artist, the launched application will return various details such as artist photos, popular songs, and top albums from both Spotify and YouTube. We used certain technologies such as Spotify and YouTube APIs to help make this possible. 

Music is a core part of life for many people, so our drive to create this application was built around providing a service that will help others learn more about their favorite artists and discover new music easily. We want everyone to be able to explore different genres and find their new favorite songs, and this is the perfect application to help. It is extremely user-friendly and accessible with a simple and easy-to-read layout. 


### What we did
* We started out by setting up basic HTMl and then adding CSS from a Bulma framework to aid in making the webpage clear and polished. Javascript was added, and the YouTube API was made to get thumbnails and titles of the top three searches for any artist. We linked YouTube videos to thumbnails so the links are working and interactive via the click function. Artist searched was put in local storage to be pulled through the click function on the submit button. A click function was created that makes thumbnails display artists, and we created a loop that would generate a button for each artist put in local storage for search history. Using the Spotify API, the top three songs, top three albums, and the artist's icon are displayed.
